# MCSE

> My master's degree monolith.

This repository condensates all the projects and assignments I did during my master's degree at [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl). MCSE stands for "Master Computer Science and Engineering".

## Other Repositories

Certain projects did not fit into this monolith repository, so I kept them separate. Here's the ones:

- BlockLearning Framework: https://github.com/hacdias/blocklearning
- BlockLearning Data Set and Raw Results: https://github.com/hacdias/blocklearning-data
- Fintracts (from *Capita Selecta* course): https://github.com/hacdias/fintracts
