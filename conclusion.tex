\section{General Conclusions}

\section{Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designed and implemented the first open-source modular framework for Blockchain-based Federated Learning that can be easily adapted to support new scoring, aggregation and privacy techniques.
    
    \item Provided the first comparative study of how different aspects of Blockchain-based Federated Learning, namely consensus algorithms, participant selection techniques and scoring techniques, impact the accuracy, execution time and communication and computation costs.
    
    \item Provided the first comparative study of how the number of training devices and different levels of privacy impact the accuracy, execution time and communication and computation costs of different scoring techniques.
    
    \item Designed and implemented the first open-source proof-of-concept of a Blockchain-based Vertical Federated Learning.
\end{enumerate}
