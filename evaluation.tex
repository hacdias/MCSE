\todo{The things below are just notes.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Epochs}: 50 to be able to compare with other papers.
    
    \item \textbf{Dataset}: MNIST \cite{lecun2010mnist} as it is the one that occuirs the most in most papers. Widely known and well tested datasets and can be used for both HFL and VFL as long as paritionly correctly.
    
    \item \textbf{Model}: simple/generic CNN that works reasonably fine for both datasets since they are quite simple datasets. The goal of this project is not to have a fantastic model, but to compare how different blockchain FL aspects affect the model.
\end{itemize}
