\todo{The things below are just notes.}

Machine hardware specifications used for the evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor 4.2 GHz
    \item RAM: 64 GB
    \item Disk: 500 GB NVMe
\end{itemize}

Software:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Docker version 20.10.15, build fd82621
    \item Docker Compose version v2.5.0
    \item Node.js version \todo{XXX}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Epochs}: 50 to be able to compare with other papers.
    
    \item \textbf{Dataset}: MNIST \cite{lecun2010mnist} as it is the one that occuirs the most in most papers. Widely known and well tested datasets and can be used for both HFL and VFL as long as paritionly correctly.
    
    \item \textbf{Model}: simple/generic CNN that works reasonably fine for both datasets since they are quite simple datasets. The goal of this project is not to have a fantastic model, but to compare how different blockchain FL aspects affect the model. Show both vertical and horizontal.
\end{itemize}
