In this chapter, we provide information on the evaluation of the experiments, such as which data set was used, how it was partitioned, which models were used, among others. In the end, we provide an overview of all of the executed experiments, compared to the literature.

\section{Data Set}

The data set used for the experiments is the MNIST \cite{lecun2010mnist} data set. The MNIST data set includes 70 000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, where each image is 28 by 28 pixels. The main motivation behind this choice is that this is a widely known data set that is also used by a large part of the reviewed works.

\section{Model}

\subsection{Horizontal: CNN}

% simple/generic CNN that works reasonably fine for both datasets since they are quite simple datasets. The goal of this project is not to have a fantastic model, but to compare how different blockchain FL aspects affect the model. Show both vertical and horizontal.

\subsection{Vertical: SplitNN}
